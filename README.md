# Pomodoro Buddy
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Tired of seeing ads, I wanted to revamp a previous work 

View my updated pomodoro timer app [here](https://pomodoro-buddy.vercel.app/).

How to use:
- Pomodoro: 25-minute work session
- Short Break: 5-minute rest
- Long Break: 15-minute rest

Note: this is a remake to another pomodoro timer app I made back when learning to code. You can view that [here](https://github.com/JohnMichaelD/tomato-timer).

# Issues Faced:
- set interval was not actually committing time correctly
- adding animate for correct time tracking, but interval for tab
- getting fish to return to center when cursor leaves screen

# Features to add:
- I'd like to add better animations. Add a 3D rendered clownfish. Either using three.js or similar
- Gamification. Add fun features like fish food recieved after every completed cycle or to do item. Feed fish
- Add a simple to do list
- Add feature flags for practice
- Update follow feature to work for mobile touch
